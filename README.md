Vanilla JS + JestJS for Unit Testing

Conway Game of Life Function Solution with Jest.js

The initial repository that this is for is from the Retrium Coding Lab/Interview process.

I decided not to fork it directly as someone else who was trying to take the test/lab could potentially see my answers.

#### Rules

Conway's Game of Life takes place on a grid of any size where each cell of the grid can be either alive or dead.

It follows three simple rules through the generations

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives the round
2. ANy dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarily, all other dead cells stay dead.

The function that is in this can take and process a grid of cells and produce the next results. Run continuously it can iterate through all forms within the initial grid size.

The input value for this is a 2 dimensional array.
